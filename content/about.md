My name is Theis Pieter and I am a 19 year old software engineering apprentice.

I listen to a lot of garage rock and tangentially related genres of music, such as anything to do with rock, hyperpop and metal, and could probably fit a page or three about the specific attachment and memories I have with certain songs and genres.

I am interested in all things programming, with most of it being done with the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which I have been using since december of 2021, with it quickly becoming the language I am most comfortable with; in my day job, however, I mostly use TypeScript and C# with some spots of Rust here and there when applicable.

I have some interesting projects on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/camper0008) such as [vc2-tools](https://github.com/camper0008/vc2-tools), which is some assorted tools such as a VM, assembler, debugger and other utilities for a custom computer architecture called [Virtual Computer 2](https://github.com/simonfj20/vc2), as defined by my good friend and colleague [Simon](https://sfja.dk).

Additionally, I am also interested in other areas of technology, such as user interface & experience design, system administration, and GNU/Linux, with my current distribution being [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), which I've come to enjoy due to the philosophy of reproducible builds meaning I can write it once and it will work anywhere (other than hardware differences). I run it both for my servers and my desktop environment. My [current nix config is available on GitHub](https://github.com/camper0008/my-nix).
